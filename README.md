Monitoring tools which eases the job of monitoring critical services.

At present the Repo has one tool that monitors the windows services continously in the background by consuming less amount of RAM & CPU. It sends "issue mail" alert when the critical services
are down and "resolved mail" alert when the issue is resolved.
